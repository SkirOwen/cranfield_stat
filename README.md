# cranfield_stat

This is a complete version and commented of the code used for the assignment.  

`poly.py` is for the polynomial fit.  

`finding_fit.py` is to some test to get the feel for the database, as well as trying different re-scalling of y (ttf) to
 get a linear relationship with the different x values.
